      <h2>This is the FAQs (also known as the you made me write a rule about it section)!</h2>
      <p>
        If it was you, don't take it personally!<br>
        This is how we grow and get better, and the<br> 
        easier I can make it by pointing people here<br> 
        the more hair I'll keep.

        <p>
          <br><span style = 'font-size: larger;'>Anyone can invite new people to the Server!</span><br>
          <br>We love new friends, but also want to avoid<br>
          toxic people and trolls, we have enough of those.<br>
          So in order for the new person to be given the Friend <br>
          role and access to the Voice and Text Channels, there <br>
          are a couple of steps.<br>
        </p>
  
        <ol>
          <li>Invite them by right clicking their name or creating a MNG invite</li>
          <li>Once they enter, introduce them in #introductions  (Or have them introduce themselves but drop your name)</li>
          <li>A wingdude should pass them the Friend role upon introduction</li>
          <li>They should come read the #rules-and-reminders and hit up #roke-assignment</li>
        </ol>
  
        <p>Full disclosure for this process: We want<br>
          recourse if things go poorly, and knowing<br>
          connections and friendships is helpful in<br>
          having the tougher discussions<br>

      <h4 class = 'rule-title' tabindex="9">Requesting a Game be Added to Reaction Roles</h4>
      <section class = 'rule p-border'>

        <p>Do you want a game added to the<br>
          #role-assignment channel? Do you want to be able<br>
          to ping (pester) loads of friends to play<br>
          a game with you?
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ensure the game is already being played by a few people on the server.<br>
            If it's not being played yet: It's your job to promote it and take the lead on getting people involved!<br>
            If a game is being played, then we can create a role for it:<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>Provide a Wing Dude the following details:<br>
            Name of the Game<br> 
            Category # on #role-assignment  (1-5)<br>
            Emoji. (Pick one that isn't already being used, stock emoji's preferred)

      <section class = 'rule p-border'>

        <ol>
          <li>Please bring it to us before Monday!<br><br></li>
          <li>Give people a heads up so they can buy<br>
              it, get it downloaded, play the tutorial,<br>
              whatever needs to happen to make game go vroom.<br>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><br><br>Otherwise it won't get voted for and played and/or<br>
          we'll all sit around on game night waiting for a download<br>
          or listening to each other play the tutorial</p>

    <section>
      <h4 class = 'rule-title' tabindex="11">Getting Games Going on Monday Night</h4>
      <section class = 'rule p-border'>

        <p>Please at least come say hello in the game night voice chat, night of!!!<br><br>
          But if you want to play something and other people voted for it,
          then tell them and help the process along!<br><br>
          We aren't mind readers and there's only so many times I can suggest trying a
          different game once things get going. Hit us with that clue by four.<br><br>
          Please, don't be shy!!! The infrastructure is set like this for a reason,
          we will get you set up in a Voice Chat (Yes, even if we need to make a new room!)
